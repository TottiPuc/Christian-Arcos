Iâ€™m an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R programming. I specialize in machine learning techniques, 
and data wrangling. I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!

I am a Colombian man dedicated entirely to the study of the different areas, novelties and tools that technology provides, especially everything related to the artificial intelligence world. Since I was doing my high school studies, I have already carried out projects that consisted of creating voice synthesizers, since from that time I was interested in analyzing routine situations that had to do with the advantages that artificial intelligence could offer in its different scopes.
In 2011 I received the grade of electronic engineer and my interest in machines and signal processing grew. I followed an adventure thanks to the Brazilian government that allowed me to start my master's degree in telecommunications without even imagining that the university I entered had one of the most important and recognized voice processing exponents in Brazil and the world due to his contributions in this field to the international community and who would become my tutor and friend during my stay there.
It was then that speech processing, machine learning and all its components, such as statistics, probability, signal theory, etc., brought me to the point of entering this world of which I have learned so much and that each day manages to fall in love more, for all the wonders that can be achieved through its development and for everything it offered me during my master's and doctorate stay in Brazil, such as touring the world presenting my work at conferences, I even achieved great recognition which I feel proud of since that I got a mention as the best conference paper in the Continuous Voice Enhancement and Processing Area.
I believe that we learn continuously and due to the new challenges that the world presents to us, it is essential to update and take care of transmitting the knowledge acquired to the new generations, who unfortunately have largely lost interest in study and research in general. This is why one of my objectives is to help people who want to enter this wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence and develop projects that generate direct benefits for people who suffer from some type of disability, especially those with hearing impairments.
