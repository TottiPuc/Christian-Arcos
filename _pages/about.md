I'm a Machine Learning scientist that was born in Pasto - Colombia a city located in the Atriz Valley on the Andes cordillera, at the foot of the Galeras volcano.

In 2011 I had my bachelors degree as Electronic Engineer from  Francisco de Paula Santander University. (Colombia), where I did my final work on Supervise and support in mechatronic automation projects from International Clean Production Center Lope from SENA and it was at this time where my interest in machine learning and signal processing grew.

I followed my instincts and for the next 2 years after 2011 I started an adventure thanks to the Brazilian government that allowed me to start my master degree at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.  Where I did my dissertation in Continuous Speech Recognition with MFCC and PNCC features and robustness techniques Wavelet Denoising, Histogram Mapping, Spectral Subtraction and Filter with Neural Networks.

After spendig some time working on a relevant project (SAPDA group) from AGM consulting companny that provided me with the skill sets to be an effective researcher in speech enhancement. I began working on my Ph.D. in Speech Recongnition at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. My thesis cover a range of topcis in Speech Enhancement and continuous speech recognition in adverse environments. 
I have published over 8 articles an gave over 5 public talks and lectures and I even achieved great recognition which I feel proud of since that I got a mention as the best conference paper in the Continuous Voice Enhancement and Processing Area (For more details take a look at my resume.)

I believe that we learn continuously and due to the new challenges that the world presents to us, it is essential to update and take care of transmitting the knowledge acquired to the new generations, who unfortunately have largely lost interest in study and research in general. This is why one of my objectives is to help people who want to enter this wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence and develop projects that generate direct benefits for people who suffer from some type of disability, especially those with hearing impairments.
